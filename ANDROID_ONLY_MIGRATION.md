- ✅ **Restored packages**: Re-restored NuGet packages for Android target only
- ✅ **Verified clean builds**: Confirmed successful Android-only builds

## 🎯 Current Project Focus

### ✅ **Supported Platforms**
- 📱 **Android 7.0+** (API level 24+)
- ⌚ **Wear OS 2.0+**

### ✅ **Key Technologies**
- 🔷 **.NET 9.0** with .NET MAUI framework
- 🔗 **Plugin.BLE** for Bluetooth Low Energy
- 🏗️ **MVVM Architecture** with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- 🔧 **Android SDK** for platform-specific features

### ✅ **Available Build Targets**
- `net9.0-android` - Primary and only target framework
- Android Debug builds for development
- Android Release builds for distribution
- Wear OS optimized builds via build properties

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Development Workflow
1. **Use Android-only tasks**: All VS Code tasks now focus on Android/Wear OS
2. **Test on real devices**: Use connected Android phones and Wear OS watches
3. **Deploy via ADB**: Utilize the ADB-based deployment tasks for device testing

### Build Commands
```bash
# Debug build
dotnet build -f net9.0-android -c Debug

# Release build
dotnet build -f net9.0-android -c Release

# Wear OS build
dotnet build -f net9.0-android -c Release -p:WearOSTarget=true
```

### VS Code Tasks (Quick Access)
- `🤖 Android Debug` - Primary development builds
- `🚀 Android Release` - Production builds
- `📱 Install Android` - Deploy to Android device
- `⌚ Install Wear OS` - Deploy to Wear OS device
- `📱 Check Devices` - Verify device connectivity

## 🎉 Benefits of Android-Only Focus

### ✅ **Simplified Development**
