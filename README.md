- **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)** - Required for device management and VSCode tasks

### 🔧 Installing Android Debug Bridge (ADB)

ADB is essential for the VSCode tasks to work properly, especially the "📱 Check Devices" task. Here are installation methods for different platforms:

#### Windows (Recommended: winget)

```bash
# Install via Windows Package Manager (easiest method)
winget install Google.PlatformTools

# After installation, restart your terminal or VSCode
# Verify installation
adb version
adb devices
```

#### Windows (Alternative: Manual Installation)

1. **Download Android Platform Tools** from [Google](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
2. **Extract** the ZIP file to `C:\platform-tools\`
3. **Add to PATH**:
   - Open System Properties → Environment Variables
   - Add `C:\platform-tools\` to the PATH variable
   - Restart terminal/VSCode
4. **Verify**: `adb version`

#### macOS

```bash
# Via Homebrew (recommended)
brew install android-platform-tools

# Via MacPorts
sudo port install android-platform-tools

# Verify installation
adb version
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Install via apt
sudo apt update
sudo apt install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot

# Verify installation
adb version
```

#### Linux (Other Distributions)

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S android-tools

# Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf install android-tools

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install android-tools
```

#### Verification

After installation, verify ADB is working:

```bash
# Check ADB version
adb version

# List connected devices
adb devices

# Start ADB server (if needed)
adb start-server
```

#### Troubleshooting ADB Installation

**Windows Issues:**

```bash
# If PATH is not updated after winget install:
# 1. Restart terminal/VSCode completely
# 2. Or manually refresh PATH in current session:
$env:PATH = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'Machine') + ';' + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'User')
```

**Permission Issues (Linux/macOS):**

```bash
# Add user to plugdev group (Linux)
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER

# Set up udev rules for Android devices (Linux)
sudo wget -S -O /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/master/51-android.rules
sudo chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

**Device Not Detected:**

```bash
# Restart ADB server
adb kill-server
adb start-server

# Check device authorization (should show on device screen)
adb devices

# Enable USB debugging on device
# Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging
```

   # Install using ADB
   adb install bin/Release/net9.0-android/com.distancealarm.app-Signed.apk
   ```

### ⌚ Wear OS Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Wear OS device with Developer Mode enabled
- Wear OS companion app installed on paired phone

#### Installation Steps

1. **Enable Developer Mode on Wear OS**

   - Go to Settings → System → About
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Go back to Settings → Developer Options
   - Enable "ADB Debugging" and "Debug over Wi-Fi"

2. **Prepare Wear OS device for ADB connection**

   **Important**: Before you can install on Wear OS, you first need to do an `adb pair ...` then `adb connect`.

   **Hint**: Set the developer option "Keep display on during charging" or extend your display on time to give ADB longer time to pair and connect.

   ```bash
   # Step 1: Pair with Wear OS device (first time only)
   # Find the pairing information in Developer Options → Wireless debugging
   # Look for "Pair device with pairing code"
   adb pair [WEAR_OS_IP]:[PAIRING_PORT]
   # Enter the 6-digit pairing code shown on your Wear OS device

   # Step 2: Connect to Wear OS device
   # Use the IP and port from "IP address & Port" in Wireless debugging
   adb connect [WEAR_OS_IP]:5555

   # Verify connection
   adb devices
   ```

3. **Connect Wear OS device (detailed steps)**

   ```bash
   # Example pairing process:
   # 1. On Wear OS: Settings → Developer Options → Wireless debugging → Pair device with pairing code
   # 2. Note the IP address and pairing port (e.g., 192.168.1.100:12345)
   # 3. Note the 6-digit pairing code

   adb pair 192.168.1.100:12345
   # Enter pairing code when prompted: 123456

   # After successful pairing, connect using the regular port (usually 5555)
   adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555

   # Verify your Wear OS device appears in the list
   adb devices
   ```

4. **Deploy to Wear OS**

   **Important**: Wear OS devices typically use ARM architecture (`armeabi-v7a`), so you need to build specifically for this architecture.

   ```bash
   # Method 1: Build for ARM architecture and install via dotnet (Recommended)
   dotnet build -f net9.0-android -c Debug -p:WearOSTarget=true -p:RuntimeIdentifiers=android-arm

   # Then manually install the APK via ADB
   adb -s [WEAR_OS_IP]:5555 install -r "bin\Debug\net9.0-android\com.distancealarm.app-Signed.apk"

   # Method 2: Use the updated VS Code task
   # Press Ctrl+Shift+P → Tasks: Run Task → ⌚ Install Wear OS
   ```

   **Architecture Check**: If installation fails with `INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS`, check your device architecture:

   ```bash
   # Check Wear OS device architecture
   adb -s [WEAR_OS_IP]:5555 shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
   # Common result: armeabi-v7a (ARM 32-bit)

   # Build for the correct architecture
   dotnet build -f net9.0-android -c Debug -p:WearOSTarget=true -p:RuntimeIdentifiers=android-arm
   ```

#### Wear OS Connection Tips

- **Keep display active**: Enable "Keep display on during charging" in Developer Options to prevent the watch from sleeping during the pairing process
- **Extend screen timeout**: Go to Settings → Display → Screen timeout and set it to the maximum time (30 seconds or more)
- **Stay on Wi-Fi debugging screen**: Keep the Wireless debugging screen open during the pairing process
- **Re-pair if needed**: If connection fails, you may need to unpair and pair again
- **Check firewall**: Ensure your computer's firewall allows ADB connections on the specified ports

#### Troubleshooting Wear OS ADB Connection

```bash
# If pairing fails, restart wireless debugging
# On Wear OS: Developer Options → Wireless debugging → Turn off/on

# Check if device is paired but not connected
adb devices  # Should show device as "offline" or "unauthorized"

# Force disconnect and reconnect
adb disconnect [WEAR_OS_IP]:5555
adb connect [WEAR_OS_IP]:5555

# Reset ADB server if connection issues persist
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```
