# Device Name Display Fix - Summary

## Problem
When scanning for Bluetooth devices, device names were not shown properly in the UI. The issue occurred because device names were not being updated properly when a device was discovered multiple times during scanning.

## Root Cause
The `OnDeviceDiscovered` method in `MainViewModel.cs` only updated the `RssiValue` and `LastSeen` properties of existing devices, but did not update the `Name` property. This meant that if a device initially broadcast without a name (showing "Unknown") and later broadcast with a proper name, the UI would continue to show "Unknown".

## Solution
The fix involved three main changes:

### 1. Fixed OnDeviceDiscovered Method
Updated the `OnDeviceDiscovered` method in `ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs` to properly update all device properties when a device is rediscovered:

```csharp
// Before: Only updated RssiValue and LastSeen
existingDevice.RssiValue = device.RssiValue;
existingDevice.LastSeen = device.LastSeen;

// After: Update all relevant properties including Name
existingDevice.Name = device.Name;
existingDevice.RssiValue = device.RssiValue;
existingDevice.LastSeen = device.LastSeen;
existingDevice.Device = device.Device;
```

### 2. Enhanced DisplayName Logic
Improved the `DisplayName` property in `Models/BleDevice.cs` to provide better fallback logic:

```csharp
// Before: Simple fallback to "Unknown Device"
public string DisplayName => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(Name) ? Name : "Unknown Device";

// After: Better logic with MAC address fallback
public string DisplayName => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Name) && Name != "Unknown" ? Name : 
                            !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(MacAddress) ? $"Device ({MacAddress})" : 
                            $"Unknown Device";
```

### 3. Added Property Change Notifications
Implemented `INotifyPropertyChanged` in the `BleDevice` class to ensure the UI updates properly when device properties change. This is crucial for real-time updates in the device list.

### 4. Improved Device Name Processing
Enhanced the `OnDeviceAdvertised` method in `Services/BluetoothService.cs` to better handle device name extraction and added debug logging for troubleshooting.

## Benefits
- Device names now update properly when a device broadcasts its name after initially being discovered as "Unknown"
- Better fallback display names using MAC addresses when device names are not available
- Real-time UI updates through proper property change notifications
- Improved debugging capabilities with logging
- More robust handling of edge cases (empty names, whitespace, etc.)
